# Milestone v1.1: Module 2 Content

**Status:** In Progress
**Phases:** 11+
**Total Plans:** TBD

## Overview

Add Module 2 content covering AI, Machine Learning, and Prediction in Marketing. This module includes 8 lectures covering:
- Introduction to AI/ML in Marketing
- Machine Learning Frameworks (Bias-Variance, Train-Test Split)
- Geotracking Data and Privacy Trade-offs
- Large Language Models for Market Research
- Prediction vs Causality
- Ethical Implications of AI
- Smartwatch Adoption Case Study (Lectures 7-8)

## Phases

### Phase 11: Module 2 Content

**Goal:** Complete Module 2 (AI, Prediction, and Machine Learning) with all 8 lectures transformed into visual content with animations and interactivity
**Depends on:** Phase 10 (v1.0 complete)
**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 11-01: Module data + Lectures 1-2 (AI/ML intro, ML frameworks) — completed 2026-01-22
- [x] 11-02: Lectures 3-4 (Geotracking/Privacy, LLMs for research) — completed 2026-01-22
- [ ] 11-03: Lectures 5-6 (Prediction+Causality, AI Ethics)
- [ ] 11-04: Lectures 7-8 (Smartwatch case study, Python demo) + glossary + questions

**Wave Structure:**
- Wave 1: 11-01 (foundation)
- Wave 2: 11-02 (depends on 11-01)
- Wave 3: 11-03 (depends on 11-02)
- Wave 4: 11-04 (depends on 11-03)

**Details:**
Key visualizations by lecture:
- L1: Why AI/ML matter now (3-step build-up), Prediction cost reduction
- L2: Train-test-validation split, Bias-variance U-curve animation
- L3: Geotracking accuracy boost, Privacy vs accuracy trade-off graph
- L4: LLM workflow (question → GPT → comparison), Demand curves
- L5: Prediction vs causality comparison, ML + Causal regression integration
- L6: Bias amplification flow, Debiasing trade-off, Three fairness lessons
- L7: Binary classification setup, ML vs econometrics comparison
- L8: Classification metrics, Model comparison (Logistic → RF)
