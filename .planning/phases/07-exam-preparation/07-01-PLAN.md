# Plan 07-01: Question Bank & Content

## Objective

Create a comprehensive question bank with 100 flashcard questions for Module 1 (Causal Analysis), organized by difficulty level (40 hard, 40 medium, 20 easy). Questions should leverage the visual diagrams and concepts from the lectures.

## Dependencies

- Phase 6 complete (Module 1 content exists)
- Existing diagram components from Phase 4-5

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Question Types and Data Structures

Create `src/lib/exam/types.ts`:
- `Question` interface with id, text, answer, difficulty, lectureId, diagramData (optional)
- `QuestionDifficulty` type: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard'
- `QuestionCategory` for organizing by lecture topic

### Step 2: Create Question Bank for Module 1

Create `src/lib/exam/questions/module1.ts`:
- 20 easy questions (basic concept recognition)
- 40 medium questions (concept application, diagram interpretation)
- 40 hard questions (complex scenarios, multi-concept integration)

Questions should cover all 8 lectures:
1. Introduction to Causal Analysis
2. Key Thinkers (Neyman, Rubin, Pearl)
3. Randomized Experiments (RCTs)
4. Matching Methods
5. Instrumental Variables
6. Field Experiment Example
7. Difference-in-Differences
8. Python Demo (DID)

### Step 3: Create Question Utilities

Create `src/lib/exam/utils.ts`:
- `selectQuestions(count, difficulty, questions)` - select random questions based on criteria
- `shuffleArray()` - Fisher-Yates shuffle
- `getQuestionsByDifficulty()` - filter questions
- `getQuestionsByLecture()` - filter by lecture topic

### Step 4: Create Index Exports

Create `src/lib/exam/index.ts`:
- Export all types
- Export question bank
- Export utility functions

## Verification

- [ ] 100 total questions exist in module1.ts
- [ ] Questions cover all 8 lectures
- [ ] Distribution: 20 easy, 40 medium, 40 hard
- [ ] Questions include diagram references where appropriate
- [ ] Utility functions work correctly

## Estimated Scope

- 4 new files
- ~800-1000 lines of question content
