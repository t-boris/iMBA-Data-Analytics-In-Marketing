### Step 2: Create Quiz Configuration Store

  - Easy: "Basic concept recognition"
  - Medium: "Apply concepts to scenarios"
  - Hard: "Complex multi-concept questions"
  - Mixed: "Variety of all difficulty levels"
- Preview of question distribution based on selection

### Step 4: Style the Exam Prep Page
