# Plan 07-03: Flashcard Component & Quiz Flow

## Objective

Create the flashcard component with flip-to-reveal UX and the quiz flow that presents questions one at a time with navigation controls.

## Dependencies

- Plan 07-01 (question bank)
- Plan 07-02 (quiz configuration)

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Flashcard Component

Create `src/lib/components/exam/Flashcard.svelte`:
- Front side: Question text + optional diagram
- Back side: Answer with explanation
- Flip animation on click/tap
- Visual indicator for difficulty level
- Keyboard support (Space to flip)

### Step 2: Create Quiz Page Route

Create `src/routes/exam-prep/quiz/+page.svelte`:
- Load questions based on URL params or store config
- Display current flashcard
- Progress indicator (e.g., "3 of 10")
- Navigation: Previous, Flip, Next buttons
- Self-assessment buttons: "Got it" / "Need review"

### Step 3: Create Quiz Navigation Component

Create `src/lib/components/exam/QuizNav.svelte`:
- Previous/Next buttons
- Flip card button
- Progress bar
- Exit quiz button (with confirmation)

### Step 4: Integrate Diagrams into Flashcards

- Render CausalDiagram if question has diagramData
- Scale diagrams appropriately for flashcard size
- Ensure diagrams work on both front (question) and back (answer) sides

### Step 5: Add Quiz State Management

Update `src/lib/exam/store.ts`:
- Track current question index
- Track which cards user marked as "Got it" vs "Need review"
- Track time spent per card
