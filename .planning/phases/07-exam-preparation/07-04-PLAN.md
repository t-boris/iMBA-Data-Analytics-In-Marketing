# Plan 07-04: Progress Tracking & Results

## Objective

Create the results screen shown after completing a quiz, displaying performance metrics and allowing users to review missed questions.

## Dependencies

- Plan 07-03 (quiz flow complete)

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Results Page

Create `src/routes/exam-prep/results/+page.svelte`:
- Summary statistics:
  - Questions answered
  - "Got it" count and percentage
  - "Need review" count
  - Time spent
- Visual breakdown by difficulty
- List of questions marked for review

### Step 2: Create Results Components

Create `src/lib/components/exam/QuizResults.svelte`:
- Score display (circular progress or bar)
- Difficulty breakdown chart
- Time stats

Create `src/lib/components/exam/ReviewList.svelte`:
- List of "Need review" questions
- Click to expand and see answer
- Option to restart quiz with only missed questions

### Step 3: Create Progress Persistence

Update `src/lib/exam/store.ts`:
- Save quiz results to localStorage
- Track historical performance per module
- Calculate mastery metrics over time

### Step 4: Add "Try Again" Options

- "Retry Same Quiz" - same questions
- "New Quiz" - return to config
- "Review Missed Only" - quiz with only missed questions
- "Back to Modules" - return to learning

### Step 5: Update Exam Prep Landing

Update landing page to show:
- Recent quiz results (if any)
- Overall mastery percentage (if historical data exists)

## Verification

- [ ] Results page displays after quiz completion
- [ ] Statistics are accurate
- [ ] Review list shows missed questions
- [ ] Retry options work
- [ ] Progress persists in localStorage
- [ ] Landing page shows history (if exists)

## Estimated Scope

- 3 new files, 2 updated files
- ~350-400 lines

## Checkpoint

After this plan, Phase 7 is complete. User should test:
1. Full quiz flow from config to results
2. Different quiz lengths and difficulties
3. Flashcard flip and diagram rendering
4. Progress persistence across sessions
