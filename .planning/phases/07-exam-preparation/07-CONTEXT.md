# Phase 7: Exam Preparation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** Ready for planning

## How This Should Work

A dedicated study section separate from lectures where users can practice with visual flashcards. The flashcards leverage the causal diagrams and visualizations from Module 1 — not just plain text questions.

Users configure their study session:
1. Select quiz length: 5, 10, 15, or 25 questions
2. Select difficulty level (easy, medium, hard, or mixed)
3. System selects appropriate mix of questions based on difficulty

The experience should feel like active recall practice, with the visual elements reinforcing the conceptual understanding built in the lectures.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Visual learning** — Cards must leverage the diagrams/animations we built, not just text
- **Concept mastery** — Cover all Module 1 concepts thoroughly with clear explanations
- **Self-assessment** — Track progress, see what you know vs what needs more work

</essential>

## Specific Ideas

- 100 questions per module total
  - 40 hard questions
  - 40 medium questions
  - 20 easy questions
- Quiz length options: 5, 10, 15, 25 questions
- Difficulty selection affects question mix
- Dedicated study section (not embedded in lectures)
- Flashcard-style UX with flip to reveal answer

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This is for Module 1 (Causal Analysis) initially. The question bank should cover all 8 lectures worth of concepts. Visual elements should reuse the diagram components built in Phase 4-5.
