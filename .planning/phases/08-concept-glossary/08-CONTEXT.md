# Phase 8: Concept Glossary - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A searchable glossary page where users can quickly look up definitions of key concepts from the course. Each concept has a visual definition that leverages the diagrams and explanations built in earlier phases.

The glossary serves as a reference tool separate from the linear lecture flow — users can jump directly to any concept they need to review.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Quick search** — Find concepts instantly by typing
- **Visual definitions** — Not just text, include diagrams where relevant
- **Cross-references** — Link related concepts together
- **Module organization** — Group concepts by which module/lecture they come from

</essential>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Searchable list with instant filtering
- Alphabetical index (A-Z navigation)
- Each concept card shows:
  - Term name
  - Short definition (1-2 sentences)
  - Related concepts (clickable links)
  - Source lecture reference
  - Optional diagram/visualization
- Categories/tags for filtering (e.g., "Methods", "Assumptions", "Estimators")

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

Start with Module 1 (Causal Analysis) concepts. Key terms to include:
- Causal inference, Counterfactual, Potential outcomes
- ATE, ATT, ATU, LATE
- Selection bias, Confounding, Omitted variable bias
- RCT, Randomization, Treatment/Control
- Propensity score, Matching, Balance
- Instrumental variable, Exclusion restriction, Relevance
- Difference-in-differences, Parallel trends
- DAG, Backdoor path, Collider

Reuse DiagramData from existing lecture content where possible.
