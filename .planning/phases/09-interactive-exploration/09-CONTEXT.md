# Phase 9: Interactive Exploration - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Interactive what-if scenario tools where users can manipulate assumptions and see how causal analysis results change. The experience should feel like 3Blue1Brown — beautiful animations that make abstract statistical concepts intuitive and visual.

Users explore questions like:
- "What happens when confounding exists vs doesn't?"
- "How do results differ using RCT vs matching vs DID on the same data?"
- "How do estimates change with more/fewer observations?"

Every change produces immediate, clear visual feedback showing cause and effect relationships in action.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Intuition building** — Users truly understand WHY methods work and WHEN they fail
- **Visual feedback** — Immediate, clear visual response to every change
- **Real concepts** — Tied to actual course concepts (confounding, selection bias, parallel trends), not abstract toy examples

All three are equally critical to the experience.

## Specific Ideas

- 3Blue1Brown-style aesthetic: smooth animations, beautiful visualizations
- What-if scenarios covering:
  - Bias exploration (confounding, selection bias)
  - Method comparison (RCT vs matching vs DID)
  - Sample size and statistical power effects
- Interactive controls that feel natural and responsive
- Each scenario reinforces concepts from Module 1 lectures

## Additional Context

This phase brings the static lecture content to life. While lectures explain concepts, this section lets users experience them firsthand. The goal is deeper understanding through play and experimentation.

Should complement the exam prep flashcards — users can explore concepts they're struggling with.
