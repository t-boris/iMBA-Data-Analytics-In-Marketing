<objective>
Create Lectures 5-6: Prediction vs Causality and AI Ethics in Marketing.

Purpose: Cover the conceptual framework connecting ML prediction with causal inference (bridging to Module 1), plus the ethical considerations of AI in marketing.

Output: Two lectures with prediction+causality integration diagrams and ethics visualizations.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Lecture 5 content - Prediction and Causality</name>
  <files>src/lib/content/module2/prediction-causality.ts</files>
  <action>
Create content connecting prediction and causality concepts.

Sections:

1. **Prediction vs Causality** (type: 'text')
   - Prediction: "What will happen?" (based on correlations)
   - Causality: "Why did it happen?" (cause-and-effect)
   - Both are essential for marketing decisions

2. **The Critical Difference** (type: 'explanation')
   Create animated comparison:
   - Step 1: "Prediction" node → "High click probability"
   - Step 2: Add question: "But did the ad CAUSE the click?"
   - Step 3: "Causality" node → "Would they click anyway?"
   - Step 4: Show both needed for full picture

3. **Mobile Advertising Case Study** (type: 'diagram')
   Two-model framework:
   - Targeting Model (ML): Predicts who should see ads
   - Market Outcomes Model (Causal): Measures economic impact
   - Edge connecting them showing workflow

4. **Key Results** (type: 'text')
   - ML targeting: +67% click-through rate
   - But surprising finding: best targeting ≠ max revenue
   - More privacy sometimes = higher revenue
   - "More prediction power ≠ more profit automatically"

5. **Combining ML + Causality** (type: 'explanation')
   Create animated integration flow:
   - Step 1: "Unstructured Data" (reviews, text)
   - Step 2: "ML/NLP" extracts features (sentiment, intent)
   - Step 3: Features feed into "Causal Regression"
   - Step 4: Output: "Estimated causal effects"

6. **Strategic Integration** (type: 'text')
   - Prediction: fast, scalable decisions
   - Causality: strategic confidence
   - Together: Tactical + Strategic Intelligence
   - This is the future of marketing analytics

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create Lecture 6 content - AI Ethics</name>
  <files>src/lib/content/module2/ai-ethics.ts</files>
  <action>
Create content for ethical implications of AI in marketing.

Sections:

1. **AI as a Double-Edged Sword** (type: 'text')
   - Benefits: personalization, accuracy, efficiency
   - Risks: inequality, privacy violations, trust erosion
   - Balance required

2. **Bias in AI Systems** (type: 'explanation')
   Create animated explanation:
   - Step 1: "Training Data" node (historical, potentially biased)
   - Step 2: Arrow to "ML Model"
   - Step 3: Arrow to "Predictions" (amplified bias)
   - Step 4: Annotation: "AI doesn't just repeat bias - it can amplify it"

3. **Transparency Problem** (type: 'diagram')
   Show user uncertainty:
   - User node with question marks
   - Hidden AI decision process
   - Recommendations output
   - Content: Users often don't know AI is making decisions

4. **Privacy and Regulations** (type: 'text')
   - GDPR (European)
   - CCPA (California)
   - Data stewardship responsibility
   - Companies as data protectors, not exploiters

5. **Fairness Research** (type: 'explanation')
   Animated example of debiasing:
   - Step 1: Show "Biased Algorithm" → "Unfair outcomes"
   - Step 2: Apply "Debiasing" intervention
   - Step 3: Small accuracy loss
   - Step 4: But more fair + sustainable results

6. **Three Lessons on Fairness** (type: 'diagram')
   Three connected nodes:
   - "Contextual" - no universal fairness formula
   - "Invisible" - bias exists without explicit markers
   - "A Choice" - debiasing is intentional strategy

7. **Summary: Responsible AI** (type: 'text')
   - AI amplifies capabilities but requires responsibility
   - Success depends on HOW it's used
   - Ethical AI Framework components: fairness, transparency, accountability
   - Long-term trust over short-term efficiency

    1. Run: npm run dev
    2. Visit: http://localhost:5174/module/ai-ml-prediction
    3. Verify Lectures 5-6 now show "Ready" badge

       - Mobile advertising case study diagram displays two-model framework
       - ML + Causality integration flow animates properly
    5. Click Lecture 6 "AI Ethics in Marketing":
       - Bias amplification animation shows data → model → predictions
       - Transparency diagram shows hidden AI decisions
       - Debiasing research animation shows fairness trade-off
       - Three lessons diagram renders with connected nodes
    6. Verify content connects to Module 1 causality concepts
    7. Check navigation works across all 6 lectures
