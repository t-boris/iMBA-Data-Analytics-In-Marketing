# Phase 11: Module 2 Content - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-22
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Same structure as Module 1 — lecture pages with markdown content, animated diagrams, and step-by-step visual explanations. Users navigate through 8 lectures covering AI, Machine Learning, and Prediction in Marketing.

Each lecture transforms course notes into an interactive visual learning experience:
- Markdown-rendered content with key concepts highlighted
- Animated diagrams that build up step-by-step (3Blue1Brown style)
- Glossary terms linked and defined
- Consistent navigation and progress tracking

</vision>

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Same polish as Module 1** — consistent quality, same design language, same UX patterns
- **Visual clarity of ML concepts** — abstract ideas like bias-variance, train-test splits, and demand curves become crystal clear through animation
- **All key visualizations done well** — each lecture needs its signature concept properly visualized

Key visualizations to implement:
- Bias-Variance trade-off curve (classic U-shape)
- ML Pipeline flow (data split → features → training → validation → testing)
- Privacy vs Accuracy trade-off graph
- AI vs ML hierarchy (nested sets)
- Human vs GPT demand curves comparison
- Prediction + Causality integration flowchart

</essential>

## Specific Ideas

Follow Module 1 patterns exactly:
- Lecture page infrastructure already exists
- Animation system (GSAP + step labels) already built
- Visualization engine (D3, CausalDiagram) ready to extend
- Design system components available

Module 2 specific content (8 lectures):
1. Intro to AI/ML in Marketing
2. ML Frameworks (Bias-Variance, Train-Test Split)
3. Geotracking Data and Privacy Trade-offs
4. LLMs for Market Research
5. Prediction vs Causality
6. Ethical Implications of AI
7. Smartwatch Adoption Setup
8. ML Models in Python

</specifics>

## Additional Context

Module 2 content source: `/Users/boris/Documents/KnowledgeDB/UIUC-iMBA/2026-Spring - Applying Data Analytics in Marketing - MBA 564A/Module 2 - Artificial Intelligence, Prediction, and Machine Learning.md`

This module introduces ML concepts after Module 1's causal inference foundation. The progression makes sense: first understand causality, then learn how ML fits into the picture (prediction) and where they complement each other.

New glossary terms will need to be added for Module 2 concepts (AI, ML, bias, variance, etc.).
