  <name>Task 1: Create Lecture 4 — Introduction to CLV Analysis</name>
  <files>src/lib/content/module4/clv-introduction.ts</files>
  <action>
  Transform Lecture 4 source notes into rich visual content. This lecture covers WHY CLV matters strategically and its key components.

  Create 7 content sections:

  1. **Text section: "What is Customer Lifetime Value?"** — CLV is the total discounted profit expected from a customer over the entire relationship. It's the central metric for customer-centric companies. Used in pre-IPO reporting, investor analytics, strategic planning. The shift: from short-term revenue to long-term customer economics.

  2. **Explanation section: "Why CLV Matters"** — 4-step animated explanation:
     - Step 1: "Strategic Importance" — CLV reflects retention value, loyalty, segment profitability, acquisition channel effectiveness. Companies with high CLV can invest more in marketing.
     - Step 2: "The Alignment Problem" — Different departments calculate CLV differently: Marketing uses it to justify ad spend, Finance for valuation, Operations may ignore it. Diagram: three department nodes pointing to different CLV values.
     - Step 3: "Metric Misalignment" — When departments use different CLV definitions: bad decisions, wrong budget allocation, KPI conflicts, strategic chaos.
     - Step 4: "Standardization Solution" — One formula across the entire company = one strategy. Single CLV definition used by marketing, finance, strategy, and operations.

  3. **Diagram section: "CLV Components"** — Show the 4 key components of CLV:
     - Node: "Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)" — type 'control' — ads, sales, promos
     - Node: "Contribution Margin" — type 'treatment' — Revenue minus variable costs
     - Node: "Retention Rate" — type 'confounder' — probability customer stays
     - Node: "Discount Rate" — type 'variable' — time value of money
     - Central node: "CLV" — type 'outcome'
     - Edges from all 4 components to CLV with labels: "reduces", "increases", "multiplies", "discounts"

  4. **Text section: "The Payback Period Trap"** — Many companies prefer simple payback period (time to recoup investment). Problem: only looks at early period, ignores long-term profit, doesn't account for retention effects. Risk: cutting profitable acquisition channels because payback seems slow.

  5. **Explanation section: "Discounted vs Undiscounted CLV"** — 3-step explanation:
     - Step 1: "Undiscounted CLV" — Simply sum future profits. Problem: $100 today ≠ $100 in 3 years. Overstates value, especially for short lifecycles. Simpler but strategically wrong.
     - Step 2: "Time Value of Money" — Money today is worth more due to inflation, risk, opportunity cost. Formula: Present Value = Future Cash Flow / (1 + r)^t
     - Step 3: "Discounted CLV" — Apply discount rate to future cash flows. Financially correct, comparable to valuation models, aligned with cost of capital. The right approach for investment decisions.

  6. **Text section: "Bonobos Guide Shops Example"** — Small offline fitting rooms where purchase happens online. CLV analysis showed: guide shop customers had higher CLV. Result: increased investment in the channel. CLV justified the format's higher cost.

  7. **Text section: "CLV as a Common Language"** — CLV enables: aligning cross-department decisions, investing in right channels, evaluating retention strategies, comparing segments, planning growth. It's not just a metric — it's the unified language of customer economics.

  All content in English. Focus on making the strategic value of CLV crystal clear before Lecture 5 dives into the math.

  <name>Task 2: Create Lecture 5 — CLV Calculation and Application</name>
  <files>src/lib/content/module4/clv-calculation.ts, src/lib/content/module4/index.ts, src/lib/data/modules.ts</files>
  <action>
  Transform Lecture 5 source notes into rich visual content. This is the quantitative heart of the module — the actual CLV formula and step-by-step calculation.

  Create 7 content sections:

  1. **Text section: "The CLV Formula"** — Present the general CLV formula:
     CLV = Σ (M × R^t) / (1 + i)^t for t = 1 to T

     Variables explained:
     - T = Planning Horizon (typically 3 years, tech companies use up to 7)
     - M = Contribution Margin (Revenue − Direct Costs, NOT revenue)
     - R = Retention Probability (0-1, probability customer stays)
     - i = Discount Rate (cost of capital, typically 10-20%)

     Key insight: longer horizon = higher CLV but more uncertainty. Use a markdown table for variable summary.

  2. **Explanation section: "Step-by-Step CLV Calculation"** — 5-step animated explanation using the music community example:
     - Step 1: "Setup" — Annual subscription: $150. Additional purchases: $50/year. Contribution margin on extras: 70% → $35. Total annual contribution: $150 + $35 = $185. Retention: 75%. Discount rate: 10%.
     - Step 2: "Year 1" — CLV₁ = $185. First year contribution captured at full value.
     - Step 3: "Year 2" — CLV₂ = 185 × 0.75 / 1.10 ≈ $126. Only 75% of customers remain, future value discounted.
     - Step 4: "Year 3" — CLV₃ = 185 × 0.75² / 1.10² ≈ $86. Each year adds less due to compounding retention loss + discounting.
     - Step 5: "Cumulative" — 1yr: $185, 2yr: $311, 3yr: $397. Show diminishing marginal contribution. Key exam insight: long relationships are valuable, but discounting compresses the future.

     Diagrams for each step showing the calculation with highlighted numbers.

  3. **Diagram section: "CLV Decay Curve"** — Visualize the diminishing yearly contribution:
     - Node: "Year 1: $185" — type 'treatment' (largest, green)
     - Node: "Year 2: $126" — type 'confounder' (medium)
     - Node: "Year 3: $86" — type 'control' (smallest)
     - Node: "Total CLV: $397" — type 'outcome' (bottom, accumulator)
     - Edges from years to total with running sum labels

  4. **Text section: "Why Each Year Adds Less"** — Two forces compress future value:
     (1) Retention < 1: each year fewer customers remain (0.75, 0.5625, 0.4219...)
     (2) Discounting: future dollars worth less (÷1.10, ÷1.21, ÷1.331...)
     Combined effect is exponential decay. Present a table showing Year 1-5 with retention probability, discount factor, and yearly contribution.

  5. **Text section: "The Retention Lever"** — Small changes in retention have outsized CLV impact. Example comparison table: 75% retention → $397 CLV vs 85% retention → much higher CLV (calculate approximate). This is why retention programs are so valuable — they affect every future year multiplicatively (R^t).

  6. **Text section: "Managerial Applications"** — CLV determines: maximum allowable CAC (if CLV = $397, spending $400 to acquire is a loss), retention program ROI, marketing investment justification, investor storytelling. Companies with high CLV can argue for more aggressive growth investment.

  7. **Text section: "Key Exam Points"** — Summary of formulas and concepts students must know:
     - CLV formula with all variables
     - Difference between contribution margin and revenue
     - Why discounting is necessary (time value of money)
     - Effect of retention on CLV (exponential through R^t)
     - Cumulative CLV interpretation
