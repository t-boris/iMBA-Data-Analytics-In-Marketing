<objective>
Create Lectures 6-7 covering AI-Generated Content's impact on engagement and Customer Churn prevention through incrementality-based targeting.

Purpose: Deliver the module's analytical perspectives on content quality (AGC vs human), churn prediction limitations, and the modern incrementality approach that combines prediction with causality.

Output: Two working lectures with visual explanations of AGC engagement paradox, LLM mechanics, churn targeting models, and uplift modeling concepts.

  <name>Task 1: Create Lecture 6 — AI-Generated Content and Engagement</name>
  <files>src/lib/content/module4/agc-engagement.ts</files>
  <action>
  Transform Lecture 6 source notes into rich visual content. This lecture examines how AI-generated content affects user engagement — the paradox of more content but less interaction.

  Create 7 content sections:

  1. **Text section: "The AGC Engagement Paradox"** — Case study: students used GenAI for discussion posts. Posts became longer, better structured, more information-dense. But engagement dropped — fewer comments, fewer interactions. Key insight: more text ≠ more engagement.

  2. **Explanation section: "How LLMs Work"** — 4-step animated explanation:
     - Step 1: "Large Language Models" — AI trained on massive text datasets to generate human-like language. Can understand context, generate responses, continue text.
     - Step 2: "Next Token Prediction" — Core mechanism: predict the most probable next word. LLMs don't "understand" meaning — they work on statistical patterns from training data. Example: "Capital of France?" → "Paris" (most probable continuation).
     - Step 3: "Content Generation Benefits" — Lower cost, reduced language barriers, lower entry threshold, faster production. Applications: articles, product descriptions, Q&A, documentation.
     - Step 4: "The Scale Problem" — AI scales content production. But content scale ↑ does not mean engagement ↑. The relationship between quantity and value is not linear.

  3. **Diagram section: "AI Content vs Human Content"** — Comparison visualization:
     - Left cluster: "AI Content" nodes — Volume (high), Structure (high), Personal Voice (low), Engagement (low) — type 'control'
     - Right cluster: "Human Content" nodes — Volume (lower), Structure (variable), Personal Voice (high), Engagement (high) — type 'treatment'
     - Center node: "Hybrid (AI + Human Editing)" — type 'outcome' — best of both worlds
     - Edges showing the optimal hybrid approach

  4. **Text section: "Why AI Content Reduces Engagement"** — Text analysis reveals AI posts have: fewer first-person pronouns, fewer personal formulations, less individuality, less "human voice." Personal Voice = expression of individual position and style. AI content is often: neutral, universal, smoothed, depersonalized. People engage with people, not with algorithms.

  5. **Text section: "Platform-Level Effects"** — Stack Overflow: decreased activity, fewer expert answers after GenAI. Freelance markets: ~21% decline in writing/coding jobs within 8 months of ChatGPT. Most affected: automation-prone tasks (routine writing, basic coding). These are structural labor market shifts.

  6. **Text section: "Content Homogenization"** — AI texts are often similar to each other — same templates, same patterns, same structure. Risks: less opinion diversity, less individuality, less creativity, lower emotional engagement. Quantity and quality are different variables.

  7. **Text section: "The Hybrid Solution"** — AI is powerful for productivity, scalability, and support. But human contribution remains critical for: engagement, trust, originality, social dynamics. Best result: AI + human editing + personal voice. The human-in-the-loop is not optional for engagement-dependent platforms.

  All content in English. Make the engagement paradox vivid and memorable.

  <name>Task 2: Create Lecture 7 — Customer Churn and Incrementality</name>
  <files>src/lib/content/module4/churn-incrementality.ts, src/lib/content/module4/index.ts, src/lib/data/modules.ts</files>
  <action>
  Transform Lecture 7 source notes into rich visual content. This lecture is about the evolution from naive churn prediction to incrementality-based targeting — one of the most actionable concepts in the module.

  Create 7 content sections:

  1. **Text section: "Churn and CLV"** — Direct link: if a customer churns, all future cash flows disappear. CLV depends on retention. So preventing churn is the most direct lever on CLV. Customer churn = lost revenue, lost margin, signal of product/pricing/competition problems.

  2. **Explanation section: "The Traditional Approach (and Its Flaw)"** — 4-step animated explanation:
     - Step 1: "Churn Prediction Model" — Build ML model on usage patterns, demographics, payment data, interaction history. Output: churn propensity score (probability of leaving).
     - Step 2: "Targeting High Risk" — Take top-N customers with highest churn risk. Launch retention campaign: discounts, bonuses, support, offers. Sounds logical.
     - Step 3: "The Hidden Problem" — Not all high-risk customers are the same. Three types exist: (1) will leave no matter what, (2) will stay no matter what, (3) will leave IF you don't intervene. Retention budget wasted on groups 1 and 2.
     - Step 4: "The Fitness Example" — 10,000 high-risk customers identified. Expensive retention campaign. Reality: some leave anyway, some would have stayed. ROI is weak because the model predicts risk, not the IMPACT of intervention.

  3. **Diagram section: "Outcome-Based vs Incrementality-Based Targeting"** — 2×2 matrix visualization:
     - Top-left: "Will Leave Regardless" (type: control) — high risk, low sensitivity
     - Top-right: "Persuadable" (type: outcome) — high risk, high sensitivity — THE TARGET
     - Bottom-left: "Safe Anyway" (type: variable) — low risk, low sensitivity
     - Bottom-right: "Might Backfire" (type: confounder) — low risk, high sensitivity
     - X-axis: "Retention Sensitivity" (low → high)
     - Y-axis: "Churn Risk" (low → high)
     - Highlight the "Persuadable" quadrant as the optimal target

  4. **Text section: "The Incrementality Revolution"** — New question: not "who will churn?" but "who can we convince to stay?" Two dimensions instead of one: (1) churn propensity — probability of leaving, (2) retention sensitivity — probability of responding to intervention. Research by Eva Ascarza showed incrementality-based targeting can reduce churn by ~8.7 percentage points compared to outcome-based models.

  5. **Explanation section: "Uplift Modeling"** — 3-step explanation:
     - Step 1: "The Concept" — Model the ADDITIONAL effect of intervention. Uplift = P(stay | treated) − P(stay | not treated). This is almost a medical approach: customer as patient, campaign as therapy.
     - Step 2: "From Prediction to Causality" — Combines ML prediction with causal reasoning. Uses experimental data and uplift modeling. It's the step from predicting outcomes to predicting the effect of actions.
     - Step 3: "Business Impact" — Resources directed only at high-response-potential customers. Higher ROI, cheaper campaigns, better customer insight. Understanding who reacts to stimuli, which mechanisms work, which segments are sensitive.

  6. **Text section: "Industry Applications"** — Telecom: who will renew contract with a discount? E-commerce: who will respond to loyalty program? SaaS: who needs onboarding support vs who doesn't? Each industry applies incrementality to focus resources on changeable outcomes.

  7. **Text section: "The Strategic Shift"** — Old model: predict churn → target high risk. New model: predict changeable churn → target influenceable customers. This is the transition from predicting outcomes to predicting the effect of actions. Incrementality is growing as businesses shift from reactive retention to proactive intervention design.
